Project 2 COP5615
What is working:
    All 4 topologies work and both algorithms work.
    Example usage: project2:superVisor(2,line,gossip).
    first argument is number of nodes this will be rounded up in both of the 2d topologies to create a perfect square.
    second argument is the topology  possible inputs: [line,full,'2D',imp2D] all atoms
    third argument is the algorithm possible inputs: [gossip, pushSum] all atoms
Important information about my implementation:
    gossip convergence is defined as all actors in network hearing rumor.
    pushSum convergence is defined as any one actor converging to the expected sum.
Largest networks with algorithm I got to work(converge):
    gossip:
        line:
        full:
        2D:
        imperfect2D:
    pushSum:
        line:
        full:
        2D:
        imperfect2D:
Bonus:
I implemented node death for both gossip and pushSum. My version of node death is that after receiving a rumor or a
S and W pair a single actor will perform a single send action and then become unresponsive(DIE). All other nodes operate
normally. This implementation seemed the most interesting as I wanted to mostly see its effect on the pushSum as A large
amount of the Sum would be lost. In gossip this would still allow for convergence as I had defined above but slow the
dispersion of the rumor. This implementation allows for pushSum to also converge as defined above. The implementation
though is still disruptive as it can no longer guarantee convergence to a correct answer in pushSum or convergence in
gossip in cases where the unaltered nodes had converged before.
