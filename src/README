What is working:
I have created a chord network. Which once initialized and filled with random data can be used to test average number of
hops per search. To test average number of hops I also distribute random keys for each actor to search for. Once
searching is completed by all actors the network is shutdown and average number of hops is outputted.

To run my chord simulation use the following command: project3:simulate(NumberOfNodes,NumberOfSearchesPerNode).

Also to note is that the total number of data entries is constant across network constructions set at 40000.
Conclusion: The network is O(log n) where n is the number of nodes in the network. I did lots of testing and determined
my implementation is logarithmic but has a sizeable constant multiple which is dropped by big O notation.

What is the largest network you managed to deal with:
The largest simulation I was able to run was 20,000 nodes each asking 1 search query. This was the limit due to system
memory limits. Each actor requires a lot of data to store their finger tables which in my implementations holds 160
entries to match the research paper implementation since sha 1 has 160 bits of output.
