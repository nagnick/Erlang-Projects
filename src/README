Project 2 COP5615
What is working:
    All 4 topologies work and both algorithms work.
    Example usage: project2:superVisor(2,line,gossip).
    first argument is number of nodes this will be rounded up in both of the 2d topologies to create a perfect square.
    second argument is the topology  possible inputs: [line,full,'2D',imp2D] all atoms
    third argument is the algorithm possible inputs: [gossip, pushSum] all atoms
Important information about my implementation:
    gossip convergence is defined as all actors in network hearing rumor.
    pushSum convergence is defined as any one actor converging to the expected sum.
Largest networks with algorithm I got to work(converge):
    gossip:
        line:
        full:
        2D:
        imperfect2D:
    pushSum:
        line:
        full:
        2D:
        imperfect2D:
